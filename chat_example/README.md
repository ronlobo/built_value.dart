# built_value chat example

A simple chat client (dart2js) and server (Dart VM).

Launch pub serve and the server, in separate terminals:

`pub serve`

`dart bin/main.dart`

You can now load the app in Dartium or any modern browser at
http://localhost:26199.

When developing, run

`dart tool/watch.dart`

to continuously update generated source.
